        "An alternative approach to creating embeddings. Instead of assigning a vector to each _word_ (e.g. a separate vector each for \"dog\" and \"dogs\"), a vector is assigned to each _subword_. For fastText, a subword is defined as a character n-gram.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "So if n=3, then a word like \"hello\" would result in vectors for \"<he\", \"hel\", \"ell\", \"llo\", \"lo>\" (note that \"<\" and \">\" are special characters). The vector for \"hello\" would be the sum of all the above vectors. This helps deal with OOV situations because vectors can still be assigned to unseen words as long as the n-grams exist in the vocabulary.<br>\n",
